# 12-24-Hour-Clock
### Project Summary
This project aims to create a time manipulation program that allows users to add hours, minutes, and seconds to a given time and display it in both 12-hour and 24-hour formats. The program provides a simple interface for users to interact with and visualize time changes.

### Strengths
- **Modular Design:** The code is organized into modular functions, such as adding hours, minutes, and seconds, and displaying the menu. This modular approach enhances code readability and maintainability.
- **Formatted Output:** The use of functions like `display12HourClock` and `display24HourClock` ensures that the time is presented in a clear and readable format.

### Areas for Improvement
- **Input Validation:** Implementing input validation to ensure users enter valid choices and time values would enhance the program's robustness and reliability.
- **Error Handling:** Adding error handling mechanisms for unexpected situations would improve the overall stability of the program.

### Challenges and Solutions
- **Handling Time Increments:** Writing the logic for handling time increments while considering wrap-around conditions posed a challenge. To overcome this, modular arithmetic was utilized to keep time values within valid ranges.

### Transferable Skills
The skills developed from this project, including modular design, input validation, and error handling, are transferable to various other projects and coursework in software development.

### Code Maintainability
To ensure code maintainability, readability, and adaptability, best practices such as using meaningful variable names, modularizing code into functions, and providing clear comments were followed. This approach enhances code readability and makes it easier for other developers to understand and modify the code in the future. Additionally, structuring the code in a modular and organized manner makes it more maintainable and adaptable to changes or future enhancements.
